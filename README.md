# continuous-ranked-probability-score
A package to compute the Continuous Ranked Probability Score (crps) (Matheson and Winkler, 1976; Hersbach, 2000), the fair-crps (fcrps) (Ferro et al., 2008), and the adjusted-crps (acrps) (Ferro et al., 2008) given an ensemble prediction and an observation.      The continuous ranked probability score is a negatively oriented score that is used to compare the empirical distribution of an ensemble prediction to a scalar observation.
